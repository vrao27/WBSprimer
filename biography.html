                <p> Rao is a multi instrumentalist, guitarist, composer based in Düsseldorf who is active in
                    different genres in music. With a strong musical background in <em>Blues, Jazz and Carnartic,</em>  he
                    finds
                    inspiration in trying to find sounds that combine elements from these genres and more. </p>

                <p>
                    Born in Bangalore, India into a family of doctors, he decided music was something he could use
                    to
                    make a difference. His first introduction into the world of sound was to carnatic music at a
                    young age. He picked up the
                    guitar at age 16
                    and has never stopped playing since.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having study classical guitar in addition to different genres like Rock, Pop and Jazz he began
                    performing with various local bands and went on to create his own band "4th and Main". He
                    eventually
                    moved to Düsseldorf,Germany where he continues to play.
